# Proggraming Bitcoin Rust Implementation

This is a reimplementation in Rust of the Python source code in Programming Bitcoin written by jimmy song, published by O'Reilly.

The purpose of the implementation is for my (@reud) learning, but I thought it would be good to give a new reference to those who read the same book, so I published it.

# Requirement
This is the version the author is using for the implementation.

**cargo 1.59.0-nightly (a359ce160 2021-12-14)**
